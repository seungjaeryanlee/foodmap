# foodmap_proj
## Description
This is the Django project backing the FoodMap app. It contains all the views, models, and other components of the app, except the free food listserv scraper (as of now, that is kept separate from this project directory).

## Installation and dependencies
This project uses Python 2.7, and the as-of-now latest version of Django, 1.10.6. You can install this version of Django using Python's package manager `pip`:
```
pip install Django==1.10.6
```
That's it! You should be all set to work on the project.
