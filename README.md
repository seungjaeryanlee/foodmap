## Git Rules
### Branchs and Commits
There should be no direct commits in the `master` branch, only merges from the `development` branch. There should also be no direct commits in the `development` branch except to update this document. All other branches should stem from the `development` branch and should be merged to it.
### Branch Naming Conventions
The name of each branch should be a 1 to 3 word summary of the feature seperated by hyphen `-`. For example, the branch for the scraper should be named `scraper`.
### Line Endings
Please use LF line ending `\n`.
