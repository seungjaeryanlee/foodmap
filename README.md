## Git Rules
### Branches and Commits
There should be no direct commits in the `master` branch, only merges from the `development` branch. There should also be no direct commits in the `development` branch except to update this document. All other branches should stem from the `development` branch and should be merged to it.

### Branch Naming Conventions
The name of each branch should be a 1 to 3 word summary of the feature seperated by hyphen `-`. For example, the branch for the scraper should be named `scraper`.

### Code conventions
#### General
- Indentation: Indent with *spaces*, indent size of 4.
- Line endings: Unix-style `\n`.

#### Python-specific
- Strings: Use single quotes.
- Header comments: Standard Python style. Immediately inside the function/class, enclosed in triple quotes, with newlines between triple quotes.
